I'm Siu-King**, an astrophysicist and nuclear and particle physicist, who got his degrees in Germany and have done 3 research projects during which. 
Due to my extensive experience in astronomical data analysis and jobs in engineering, I had some experience in Python but mostly have no idea what I am doing \jk
I used to be a solo Youtuber for a number of years so I am technically savvy on editing/processing videos, images and sounds too.
I have been modding games for years for my personal entertainment and pleasure, including but not limited to - Tale of Two Wastelands, with MO2, FNVEdit, a bit of GECK; Skyrim, Witcher 3, Mass Effect LE....and more.

I’m currently developing some simple softwares for my company, hence I am looking to gain more experience in Python, SQL, Git/Github (or others that may come up in the future).
